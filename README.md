# TwilioSend

This repo includes all files and their dependencies for the first part of CS643 project.

//a glance of the project:

This app uses Twilio php api for sending out sms messages to a predefined number. It utilizes Heroku platform for php. So
the app is up and running on this link: https://nader-twilio.herokuapp.com

Caution:- Clicking the link provided above will result in an sms message generated to my Professor's number, which is ok.
HOWEVER, this will also cost me $0.0075, so please do NOT even hover on around the link.

THANK YOU!
